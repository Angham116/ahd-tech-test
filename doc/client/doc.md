# React Routes
| Route| Require Auth| Description|
| -| -| -
| `/`| No| view projects page
| `/login`| No| view Login
| `/signup`| No| view Signup


- I didn't made backend for project, it is in constant file in client/src/constants

- And about HOC: I just made the login & signup auth with backend & front-end without check Auth pages in front-end
